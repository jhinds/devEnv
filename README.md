# vagrant_environment
Setup for my preferred development environment.

I created this just so I have an automated way to build my developemnt environment.
If you want to use this for your own development go right ahead all you need on your local machine are [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home), and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org).
